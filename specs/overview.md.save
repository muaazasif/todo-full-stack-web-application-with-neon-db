# Todo Full-Stack Web Application - Project Overview

## Project Description

The Todo Full-Stack Web Application is a modern, secure, and scalable task management system built using a spec-driven development approach. The application enables users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently with a clean and intuitive interface.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a clear separation of concerns with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js application using the App Router for navigation and component organization
- **Backend**: FastAPI RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints for data management
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL for reliable data persistence
- **Authentication**: Better Auth for secure user authentication and session management using JWT tokens

## Core Features

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**
   - Secure sign-up and login functionality
   - JWT-based session management
   - User isolation to ensure data privacy

2. **Todo Management**
   - Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for todos
   - Categorization and tagging of tasks
   - Priority and due date settings

3. **User Interface**
   - Responsive design that works across devices
   - Clean and intuitive user experience
   - Real-time updates and notifications

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance API development
- **Database ORM**: SQLModel for unified data modeling
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL for cloud-native PostgreSQL experience
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with App Router
- **Authentication**: Better Auth for secure user management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or similar for responsive design
- **State Management**: React Query or similar for data fetching and caching

## Security Measures

- JWT token-based authentication for all API requests
- User data isolation to prevent unauthorized access
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

## Development Principles

This project strictly follows the principles outlined in the project constitution:

- Spec-driven development: All features must be defined in specifications before implementation
- No manual coding without corresponding specs
- Proper authentication and authorization on all endpoints
- API isolation and security enforcement via JWT tokens
